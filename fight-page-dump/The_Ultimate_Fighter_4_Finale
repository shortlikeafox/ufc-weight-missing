The finale was aired on November 11, 2006.\n</p>, <p>This series featured a change from the usual <i>Ultimate Fighter</i> format. Instead of UFC hopefuls, the cast was composed of fighters that had fought in the UFC but had yet to win a <a href="/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship" title="Ultimate Fighting Championship">UFC</a> title. The winners in the <a href="/wiki/Middleweight_(MMA)" title="Middleweight (MMA)">middleweight</a> and <a href="/wiki/Welterweight_(MMA)" title="Welterweight (MMA)">welterweight</a> divisions earned a UFC title shot in their division and a $100,000 purse, along with a $100,000 sponsorship deal with Xyience.

The team that had won the last match decided the next match, with a coin toss deciding which team set the first matchup.\n</p>, <p>The winners of each division were scheduled to have their title shot during the first half of 2007. Matt Serra defeated Georges St-Pierre for the <a href="/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions" title="List of UFC champions">UFC Welterweight Championship</a>, while Lutter lost to Anderson Silva in a non-title bout.
