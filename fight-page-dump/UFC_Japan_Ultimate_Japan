However, the division was disestablished after one successful title defence and the Champion\'s reign lasted a mere 94 days<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>.\n</p>, <p>In an attempt to gain attention for the Japanese <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_(professional_wrestling)" title="Kingdom (professional wrestling)">Kingdom Pro Wrestling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hiromitsu_Kanehara" title="Hiromitsu Kanehara">Hiromitsu Kanehara</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yoji_Anjo" title="Yoji Anjo">Yoji Anjo</a> signed on to compete in the <a href="/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship" title="Ultimate Fighting Championship">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a>\'s <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UFC_Japan#Results" title="UFC Japan">Ultimate Japan</a> tournament.

The tournament was intended for heavyweights, and Sakuraba, at 183 pounds, was nearly twenty pounds beneath the UFC\'s 200 pound designation for the weight class. Reporting himself as 203 pounds in order to gain entry, Sakuraba was paired off against the 243 pound Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt and former Extreme Fighting champion, Marcus Silveira.\n</p>, <p>Following a barrage of blows by Silveira, Sakuraba dropped for a low-single, only for the fight to be prematurely ended on a KO. Referee <a href="/wiki/John_McCarthy_(referee)" title="John McCarthy (referee)">John McCarthy</a> had mistakenly thought Sakuraba to have been knocked out. A loud protest followed from the crowd and an angry Sakuraba attempted unsuccessfully to take the microphone and address the Japanese audience.
