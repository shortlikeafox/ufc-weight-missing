Vaseline is used to aid cuts in boxing as well as MMA, but applying it to parts of the body other than the face is illegal because of the element of grappling in the sport. A fighter that is "slippery" as a result of the vaseline will have an added advantage, because friction and grip are compromised.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-grease1_47-0"><a href="#cite_note-grease1-47">[47]</a></sup> UFC President Dana White addressed the issue during a radio appearance in Boston, Massachusetts.

Next, a request to monitor St-Pierre and members of the team to prevent future misconduct was made, namely a monitored shower of St-Pierre and/or hygiene cleansing.
