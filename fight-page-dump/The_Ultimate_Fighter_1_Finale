Hailed as one of the greatest fights in MMA history by many, Forrest and Stephan produced a 3-round stand-up war that went the distance.

Instead, many in attendance were surprised that Stephan chose to stand and strike with Forrest.  For three rounds, they brought the crowd to their feet in raucous applause as they battled in a non-stop, knock-down, legendary battle.  To many critics and fans, this fight showed the true heart of not only UFC fighters but of all who participate and appreciate MMA.\n</p>, <p>UFC President Dana White credits this fight as being the driving force behind the future success of the UFC, often stating that it was due to the fight that Spike TV offered them a second season of the show. In reality the second season had already been confirmed (and was in the casting stages) prior to the fight. In 2013 both Griffin and Bonnar were inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame, and whilst Griffin went on to win the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship, this fight is still considered the highlight of both fighters\' careers.\n</p>, <p>UFC 52: Couture vs. Liddell 2 was held on April 16, 2005 in <a href="/wiki/Paradise,_Nevada" title="Paradise, Nevada">Paradise, Nevada</a>.\n</p>]'
