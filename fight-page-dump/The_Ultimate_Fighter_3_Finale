There were to be no team challenges. All fighters would have to win a preliminary match before advancing to the semi-finals\xe2\x80\x94which in practice started the single-elimination tournament at the beginning of the series instead of near the end. The first preliminary match was set by the team who won a coin toss. All subsequent first-round match-ups were set by the team that won the previous match. Each fight was set for two rounds instead of the normal three. If there was a draw after two rounds, the match would go to a final, five-minute tiebreaker round.  In such a case, the judges\' final decision on the match would be based solely on the third round (unless the fight was stopped by the referee before the end of the round). Coaches were allowed to bring two other assistant coaches to assist with training, whereas in previous seasons, assistant trainers hired by the UFC worked for both camps!\n</p>, <p>This series of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ultimate_Fighter" title="The Ultimate Fighter">The Ultimate Fighter</a></i> was also the first in which fighters who reside outside North America had participated (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Bisping" title="Michael Bisping">Michael Bisping</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clitheroe" title="Clitheroe">Clitheroe</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>; Ross Pointon, <a href="/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent" title="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>).\n</p>, <p>As a part of their agreement to work as coaches for <i>The Ultimate Fighter 3</i>, Shamrock and Ortiz had a rematch of their <i><a href="/wiki/UFC_40" title="UFC 40">UFC 40</a></i> fight at <i><a href="/wiki/UFC_61" title="UFC 61">UFC 61</a></i>\n</p>, <p>A 5 disc DVD set of the entire season, full finale, and auditions was released in stores entitled The Ultimate Fighter 3: The Ultimate Grudge.\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 1: Fresh Meat (Original Air Date: 6 April 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 2: The Basketball (Original Air Date: 13 April 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 3: Team Dagger (Original Air Date: 20 April 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 4: Hitting it Hard (Original Air Date: 27 April 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 5: The Truce Is Over (Original Air Date: 4 May 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 6: The Letter (Original Air Date: 11 May 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 7: Mohawk (Original Air Date: 18 May 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 8: The Fuse Is Lit (Original Air Date: 25 May 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 9 :The Golden Boy (Original Air Date: 1 June 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 10: Full House (Original Air Date: 8 June 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 11: The Jungle (Original Air Date: 15 June 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><b>Episode 12: Bangin\' (Original Air Date: 15 June 2006)</b>\n</p>, <p><i>* Inhofer decided to quit the show.
