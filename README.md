# ufc-weight-missing
A project to record the list of UFC fighters who have missed weight and by how much.

I am having a hard time finding a website that lists all of the UFC fighters who have missed weight.  I also want to know how much they missed weight by.

My solution is to go and find the information myself.  The steps I am going to take:

1. Scrape event information from Wikipedia UFC event pages.
2. Scrape fight tables from the UFC event pages.
3. Use Natural Language Processing techniques to determine who missed weight and by how much.
4. Evaluate!  I have already manually found who missed weight for all of 2019 and some of 2018.  I will use this to evaluate how well
we are automatically finding this information.

...

After I am happy with the data I can add it to the data used for my [UFC Fight Prediction Project](https://github.com/shortlikeafox/tiger-millionaire)
